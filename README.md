# eFinancialCounsellor
This is a group project among @AhGuGu and @Stephanietan.
Our app aims to facilitate the ward admission process in restructured hospitals in Singapore
Users are able to:-
* log in for verification or sign up for new account
* update user profile and Next-of-kin details
* see pending and past admissions(if any)
* manage insurance policies
* make selections during the ward selection process that will be stored in database
